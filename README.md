## Project Background

Honkai: Star Rail has a poor way of keeping track of how many pulls you're close to pulling a 5 star character. Meaning, if you want to know how many pulls you've had from your previous 5 star, you had to look at your pull history that only shows 5 per page. This is to help keep track of how many pulls you have done and if you lost your 50/50. I also plan to work out the average of pulls it takes overall for each pull.

I also plan on having it read a CSV file that has character information and current limited banners, which will be stored in a database that the user can select the banner of and add their pulls to.
